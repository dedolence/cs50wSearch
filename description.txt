My name is Nathaniel Hoyt and this is project 0 for CS50's Web Programming with Python and Javascript.
My goal with the Google search clone was to try to clean up some of the original source code while maintaining an accurate visual resemblance. 
It has unfortunately not been optimized to be responsive, and has only been tested on a 1080p monitor using the latest version of Firefox.
Regardless, I'm proud of how similar my pages turned out.
For this project, I wasn't trying to avoid directly copying from the source, although I only used copy & paste for some of the longer more tedious elements,
like the SVG logos. Much like how fine artists train by duplicating famous works, I looked at this as an exercise in learning by reproducing.
However, I do believe that most modern websites are needlessly complicated, even relatively simple sites like Google.
A lot of that complexity is justified by adding polyfill for older browsers and ensuring it is responsive to different screen sizes.
However, often, containers get stacked on containers when it's really not necessary, so I tried to keep the DOM as flat as possible.
I did skip some of the fancier engineering, such as the scrolling "I'm Feeling Lucky" button and the dropdown selections that are populated by
Javascript instead of the <select> and <option> elements. I did include some visual touches, like the blue outline on focused elements.
The basic functionality is preserved by including a few hidden form elements; I'm pretty sure in the source page those elements are added by a script
because I couldn't find an equivalent element anywhere in the source code.
