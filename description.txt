My name is Nathaniel Hoyt and this is project 0 for CS50's Web Programming with Python and Javascript.
It has unfortunately not been optimized to be responsive, and has only been tested on a 1080p monitor using the latest version of Firefox.
Regardless, I'm proud of how similar my pages turned out.
I didn't use copy & paste much, just for some of the more tedious elements like the SVG icons.
I tried to keep the DOM as flat as possible.
I did skip some of the fancier engineering, such as the scrolling "I'm Feeling Lucky" button and the dropdown selections that are populated by
Javascript instead of the <select> and <option> elements. I did include some visual touches, like the blue outline on focused elements.
The basic functionality is preserved by including a few hidden form elements; I'm pretty sure in the source page those elements are added by a script
because I couldn't find an equivalent element anywhere in the source code.
